## React

What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for web applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, enabling complex applications to be built out of simple pieces. React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.

What is Vite?
